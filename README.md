# ProBAN

Reliable information on the strength of protein interactions and their presence in physiological and pathophysiological processes is critical to the development of therapeutics and diagnostics based on the functioning of protein-protein complexes. The most accurate are experimental methods for determining binding strength, but they have a number of limitations, as well as high labor intensity and cost. Computational methods can significantly reduce the set of potential interactions to a subset of the most likely ones, which will serve as a starting point for further laboratory experiments.

In this work, the ProBAN (Protein Binding Affinity Network) algorithm was developed, based on convolutional neural networks, which predicts the value of the dissociation constant (Kd).
